This is a temporary file for the current set of compilation directions.

I've changed the makefile by adding input parameter specifications in the makefile. If you
look at cond.mk in the RIM_PROJECT/makes directory, you will see the neccessary input parameters.

The input parameters are:
    debug
        yes  => adds -g to CFLAGS
        verbose => not implemented, may be removed
        <default none>
    verbose
        yes  => adds -DRIM_DUMP to CFLAGS, this dumps all RIM data to a log file
        <default no>
    time
        compressed => adds -DCOMPRESSED to CFLAGS. This alters the representation of time
                      as follows:
                             #define MINUTES_IN_DAY           8
                             #define HOURS_IN_DAY             2
                             #define MINUTES_IN_HOUR          4
                      the default values are:
                             #define MINUTES_IN_DAY        1440
                             #define HOURS_IN_DAY            24
                             #define MINUTES_IN_HOUR         60
    optimizer
        cplex => sets the OPTIMIZER and INCL_OPTIMIZER macros in the make file to the 
                 cplex code set
        no_opt => sets the OPTIMIZER and INCL_OPTIMIZER macros in the make file to the
                 no_opt code set
        <default no_opt>
    obj_type : NOTE this is only used in conjunction with cplex
        single => sets the OBJECTIVES macro to the $(OBJECTIVES)/single path, this configures
                  the power cost curve to a PWLinear curve with a single piece
        multiple => sets the OBJECTIVES macro to the $(OBJECTIVES)/multiple path, this
                  configures the power cost curve to a PWLinear curve with multiple pieces.
        <default linear> This sets the OBJECTIVES macro to the $(OBJECTIVES)/linear path,
                  this configures the power cost curve to a linear curve. That is, it 
                  does not use the algorithms associated with piece wise linear representations.
    model_type :
	base : this is only model we have at the moment.
        <default base>
